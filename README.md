Tribute Page

For this project we were tasked with creating what I call a page of aknowledgment, and I choose to base mine off of Stan Lee.

My reason behind choosing Stan Lee is mainly around his creative mind, I know him and Jack Kirby worked on a lot of the notable characters in marvel today, but before they met up he was already coming up with stories for comics and that is what I seek out of life.
I choose Stan Lee out of admiration for his creativity something I hope to reobtain and feel like I am starting to slowly get back thorugh all these projects. 
That creative spark that initally got me into art as a whole and lead me to initially consider pursing a creative career be it graphic design or now web development.
