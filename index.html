Lee would write stories, then send them back on Monday!</p>
        <p>The 1960s is where the shift from Timely Comics Stanley Liber would shift into Marvel's Stan Lee. In competition to DC Comics Stan was tasked with coming up with superheros to go against what DC was putting out, which led to him working with artist Jack Kirby to co-create some of the many notable marvel characters we see today such as: The Fantastic Four, The Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, and the X-Men. All of whom lived in a thoroughly shared universe which would lead to the characters coming together to form The Avengers!</p>
